# innoscripta_test_task

Welcome to the take-home challenge for the Flutter mobile developer position. We are
excited to see your skills and experience in action. The challenge is to build a time
tracking app for tasks. The app should have the following functional requirements:
1. A kanban board for tasks, where users can create, edit, and move tasks between
different columns (e.g. "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
2. A timer function that allows users to start and stop tracking the time spent on each
task.
3. A history of completed tasks, including the time spent on each task and the date it
was completed.
4. A way to export data to CSV file
